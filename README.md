## 1.0 Resumo

- [Access Streamlit dashboard](link heroku)

## 2.0 Context

<p> This dataset contains information on home sales that ocurred in Seattle area. The properties were traded in the years 2014 and 2015. 
 
## 3.0 Business Challenge

<p> The objective of this project is to find good investiments from a dataset of the House Rocket company. 
  
1.  Which properties should be acquired and at what price?
2.  Once acquired the propertie, what should the sale price be?</p>


## 4.0   Solution Strategy:

<b>Step 01.</b> Colect the dataset from Kaggle;

<b>Step 02.</b> Clean, organize and, through descriptive statistics, understand the data at hand;

<b>Step 03.</b> Define new relevant variables for data analysis;

<b>Step 04.</b> Analyse the variables and its correlations such that the proposed question will be answered;

<b>Step 05.</b> Criate a Machine Learning model that, once answered the initial questions for a dataset, can predict good investiments to new data;

<b>Step 06.</b> Dashboard criation through Streamlit


## 5.0 Solution 

<b>Used tools?</b>
- Python 3.8
- Pycharm Community
- Streamlit
- Heroku

<b>- Final product?</b>
Interactive Dashboard which can be virtual accessed from anywhere.


## 6.0 Conclusion

This project made it possible to learn and experience some tools and processes, such as: exploratory data analisys, data app criation using Streamlit and online availability with Heroku, and some Machine Learning algorithms implementation.


## 7.0 Next steps:

- [ ] Implement others ML algorithms
- [ ] Criate a profit metric to avaliate the ML predictions
